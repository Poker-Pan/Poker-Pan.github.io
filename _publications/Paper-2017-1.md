In this article, we consider the two-level stabilized nonconforming finite element methods for the stationary conduction-convection equations based on the local Gauss integration. The proposed methods are applied to solve conduction-convection equations with a special relationship of coarse mesh and fine mesh $h = 3H$ to avoid the coarse-to-fine intergrid operator. The methods involves three different corrections: Stokes correction, Oseen correction and Newton correction. Moreover, the stability and convergence of the proposed methods are deduced. Finally, numerical results are shown to validate the theory analysis and demonstrate the good effectiveness of the given method.
