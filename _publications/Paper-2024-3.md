We present and analyze two categories of efficient decoupled methods for the unsteady incompressible natural convection equations in this article.
The proposed methods include first order, second order standard form and rotational form, and are extended to any order schemes.
Some consistency items are added to help complete the stability analysis, and they disappear in non-discrete space.
Finally, the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the given methods are verified by several numerical experiments.
